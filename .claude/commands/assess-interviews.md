# Assess Interviews Workflow

Run the standardized interview assessment workflow on all candidates with interview notes.

## How It Works

During the interview, fill in the `INTERVIEW_NOTES.md` template that was generated by the `interview-prep` agent:

```
evaluations/developers/2024-01-15_⭐_john-doe_32-35/
├── john-doe-evaluation.md      # Resume evaluation (already exists)
├── HR_SUMMARY_RESUME.md        # Resume HR summary (already exists)
├── john-doe-resume.pdf         # Resume (already exists)
└── INTERVIEW_NOTES.md          # <-- FILL THIS IN DURING INTERVIEW
```

**Supported file names for interview input (in priority order):**
- `INTERVIEW_NOTES.md` (preferred - structured template from interview-prep)
- `*.vtt` (Teams transcription)
- `*.srt` (subtitle transcription)
- `interview_notes.md`
- `interview.md`
- `notes.md`

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Scan for Unprocessed Interviews

Scan `evaluations/developers/` and `evaluations/managers/` for:
- Folders containing filled-in `INTERVIEW_NOTES.md` (or other supported formats)
- That do NOT already have `INTERVIEW_ASSESSMENT.md`

**How to detect a filled-in template:** Check if the `**Candidate Response:**` blocks have content beyond the placeholder text.

### Step 2: Assess Each Interview

For each candidate with unprocessed interview notes:

1. **Read the existing evaluation** to understand:
   - Role level and type (IC vs Manager)
   - Areas flagged for interview probing
   - Resume score and concerns

2. **Launch `interview-assessor` agent** with:
   - Path to interview notes
   - Path to existing evaluation
   - Role type (IC or Manager)

3. **The assessor agent will:**
   - Load interview rubric from `.org/*/`
   - Score against interview criteria
   - Apply higher standards for manager candidates
   - Detect ticket jockey patterns
   - Save `INTERVIEW_ASSESSMENT.md` to candidate folder

4. **Launch `candidate-summary-distiller`** with:
   - Evaluation folder path
   - phase=interview

5. **Agent saves** `HR_SUMMARY_INTERVIEW.md` to candidate folder

### Step 3: Report Results

Summarize:
- Total interviews assessed
- Breakdown by recommendation
- Any issues encountered

## Important Rules

- Process interviews **sequentially** to avoid conflicts
- Skip candidates who already have `INTERVIEW_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Interview notes stay in the evaluation folder (not moved)
- Both `INTERVIEW_ASSESSMENT.md` and `HR_SUMMARY_INTERVIEW.md` are created

## Context Management (CRITICAL)

To avoid context overflow when assessing many interviews:

1. **Run `/compact` before starting** if processing more than 3 interviews
2. **Process strictly sequentially** - complete one assessment fully before starting the next
3. **Never launch many agents in parallel** - parallel agent polling consumes context rapidly
4. **If you must use parallel agents:**
   - Use `run_in_background: true`
   - Check with `TaskOutput block=true, timeout=300000` (one blocking call with 5-min timeout)
   - Process in batches of 2-3 maximum
   - Run `/compact` between batches

## After Running

Each assessed candidate folder will contain:

```
evaluations/developers/2024-01-15_⭐_john-doe_32-35/
├── john-doe-evaluation.md      # Resume evaluation
├── HR_SUMMARY_RESUME.md        # Resume HR summary
├── john-doe-resume.pdf         # Resume
├── INTERVIEW_NOTES.md          # Filled-in interview notes (input)
├── INTERVIEW_ASSESSMENT.md     # Interview scoring (NEW)
└── HR_SUMMARY_INTERVIEW.md     # Interview HR summary (NEW)
```

## Example Output
