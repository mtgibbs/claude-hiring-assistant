## Strengths

Jane Doe demonstrates solid frontend expertise with three years of React and TypeScript experience in production environments at two established companies, indicating technical depth beyond surface-level exposure. She has a clear track record of improving existing systems, having led a legacy system migration to React that improved load times by 60% and building an internal design system adopted across five products. Her career shows progressive growth from junior developer to senior engineer with increasing technical scope and responsibility over five years. Her resume communication is clear and professional, with appropriate technical terminology and concise descriptions of her contributions and impact.

## Opportunities

Jane Doe's backend experience with Node.js appears to be in a supporting role rather than primary ownership, which may limit her effectiveness if the position requires significant backend responsibilities. Her GitHub profile shows meaningful projects but activity has declined over the past eight months, which could indicate a shift away from hands-on coding or simply a busy period at work that should be clarified. While she mentions testing and code review practices, she does not provide specific metrics around test coverage or quality improvements, making it difficult to assess the depth of her quality engineering focus. The interview should explore her backend depth, recent technical challenges, and specific testing strategies to build a complete picture of her current capabilities.
