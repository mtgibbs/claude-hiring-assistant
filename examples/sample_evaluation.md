# CONSOLIDATED EVALUATION

This section synthesizes all agent assessments into a final recommendation.

## Final Score

**TOTAL: 26/35 (74%)**

## Recommendation

**Acceptable - Interview if Pipeline Allows**

## Summary

### Strengths (Across All Assessments)

- Demonstrated ability to improve existing systems with measurable outcomes
- Clear career progression indicating growth trajectory
- Good communication in resume presentation

### Concerns (Across All Assessments)
- Backend experience needs verification - may be supporting role only
- GitHub activity decline could indicate shift away from hands-on coding
- Quality metrics (test coverage, etc.) not quantified

### Interview Focus Areas
1. Backend depth: Have them walk through a backend feature they owned end-to-end
2. Testing practices: Ask for specific examples of test strategy decisions
3. Recent technical work: What's the last challenging bug they debugged?
4. Architecture: How would they approach designing [relevant system]?

## Role Level Assessment

**Evaluated For:** Senior Software Engineer (L2)
**Expected:** 2-5 years experience, independent delivery, owns features

**Assessment:** Candidate meets L2 expectations with 5 years of experience and demonstrated feature ownership. Strong frontend skills align with typical L2 scope. Backend experience should be verified to ensure full-stack capability if required for the role.

**Alternative Level:** Could be strong L3 candidate in frontend-focused role given migration and design system leadership experience.
