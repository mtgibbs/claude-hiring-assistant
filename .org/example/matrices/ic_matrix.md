## Using This Matrix During Evaluation

### Resume Screening
When scoring resumes, look for evidence of competencies at the target level:

**For Mid-level (G6) candidates:**
- Technical: Implemented medium/large features, demonstrates growing expertise
- Execution: Shows ownership and independent judgment
- Leadership: Some mentoring or project leadership experience

**For Senior (G7) candidates:**
- Technical: Designed complex/multi-phase projects, recognized domain expert
- Execution: Full project ownership including process and documentation
- Leadership: Mentoring others, pioneering best practices, organizational impact

### Interview Assessment
During interviews, probe for demonstrations of these competencies:
- Ask about complex bugs they've debugged (Technical Scope)
- Explore how they handle ambiguity and make tradeoffs (Execution)
- Discuss collaboration and influence examples (Communication)
- Inquire about mentoring and team impact (Team Leadership)
- Understand their growth mindset and vision alignment (Vision and Growth)

### Red Flags
- **G5-level work at G6+ experience**: Years of experience but only shows junior-level competencies
- **Lack of ownership**: Always worked on tasks assigned, never drove initiatives
- **No mentoring/leadership**: Senior candidate with no evidence of upleveling others
- **Siloed work**: No cross-team collaboration or organizational influence

### Calibration Notes
- Experience ranges are guidelines, not hard requirements
- Focus on demonstrated competencies, not just years of experience
- Cultural differences may affect how candidates describe their work (refer to SCREENING_GUIDE.md)
- A strong G6 candidate is better than a weak G7 candidate
