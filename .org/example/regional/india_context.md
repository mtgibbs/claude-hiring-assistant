  - Most prestigious: Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras
  - Newer IITs: Still selective but less prestige
- **Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs)** - Top 6
  - Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Lucknow, Kozhikode, Indore
- **BITS Pilani** - Private, highly selective
- **Indian Institute of Science (IISc)** - Bangalore
- **Delhi University elite colleges** - St. Stephen's, Hindu College, SRCC

### Tier 2 - Strong Institutions
**Acceptance rates: 2-5%, competitive**

- Top NITs (National Institutes of Technology): Trichy, Surathkal, Warangal
- IIIT Hyderabad, IIIT Bangalore
- Top IIITs (Indian Institutes of Information Technology)
- Delhi Technological University (DTU)
- Manipal Institute of Technology
- Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)

### Tier 3 - Solid Mid-tier
**Acceptance rates: 5-15%**

- Mid-tier NITs and IIITs
- State engineering colleges (quality varies by state)
- Reputable private: PESIT, BMS College, etc.

### Tier 4 - Average/Below Average
**Acceptance rates: 50%+, often minimal screening**

- Many private engineering colleges (often termed "diploma mills")
- Less selective state universities
- Admission largely based on ability to pay
- Examples: Amity, LPU, SRM (lower selectivity branches)

## Grading System Interpretation

### CGPA (10-point scale) - Most Common
| Range | Interpretation | Percentile |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| 9.0+ | Excellent | Top 5% |
| 8.0-8.9 | Very Good | Top 20% |
| 7.0-7.9 | Good | Average to above average |
| 6.0-6.9 | Average | Below average |
| <6.0 | Below Average | Concerning |

**Note:** Grading rigor varies significantly by institution. A 9.0 from a low-tier institution may not equal a 7.5 from IIT.

### Percentage System
| Range | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 75%+ | First Class with Distinction (excellent) |
| 60-75% | First Class (good to very good) |
| 50-60% | Second Class (average) |
| <50% | Concerning |

**Note:** Indian percentages are typically lower than US equivalents.

### Key Standardized Tests
| Test | Purpose | Strong Score |
|------|---------|--------------|
| JEE Advanced | IIT entrance | Top 10,000 rank |
| GATE | Graduate aptitude | >700/1000 |
| CAT | MBA admission | 95+ percentile |

## Resume Patterns

### Common Presentation Differences
- **Length:** Indian resumes are often 3-5 pages (cultural norm, not a red flag)
- **Photos:** Often included (filter out, not relevant)
- **Personal details:** May include date of birth, marital status (ignore)
- **Formal language:** Verbose, formal tone is standard
- **Test scores:** Prominently displayed (cultural emphasis on education)

### What to Focus On
- Specific technical accomplishments with metrics
- Problem-solving examples with outcomes
- Growth trajectory and increasing responsibility
- Code samples and portfolio quality (if available)
- Consistency of claims across roles

### Common Red Flags
- Vague descriptions throughout
- Cannot identify specific projects or contributions
- Technology time travel (5 years with 2-year-old framework)
- Excessive job hopping (<1 year tenures) without explanation

---

## Cultural Communication Norms

### Interview Considerations
- **Indirect communication:** May use "we" when they mean "I"
- **Deference to authority:** May seem overly agreeable
- **Formal language:** "As per your requirement" is standard phrasing
- **Humble presentation:** May undersell accomplishments

### Adjustments for Fair Evaluation
- Ask for specific "I" contributions when candidates use "we"
- Probe deeper when answers seem overly agreeable
- Don't penalize formal language if substance is clear
- Encourage candidates to elaborate on achievements

## Socioeconomic Context

### Institution Types
| Type | Cost | Access | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| IITs/NITs | Low (~$500/year) | Pure merit | Diverse socioeconomic backgrounds |
| BITS Pilani | High (~$15k/year) | Merit + money | Requires financial resources |
| Private colleges | High (~$5-10k/year) | Minimal barriers | Often affluent families |

### Regional Variations
- **South India** (Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad): Often stronger technical programs
- **Delhi/NCR:** Concentration of top institutions but also many low-quality private colleges
- **Tier 2/3 cities:** Fewer quality options

---

## Quality Signals

### Strong Signals
- Elite institution + competitive exam rank mentioned
- Specific technical metrics and outcomes
- Active GitHub with meaningful contributions
- Progressive career growth

### Neutral/Verify
- Mid-tier institution without test scores
- High grades from less selective institutions
- Impressive titles without specific accomplishments

### Concern Signals
- Low-tier institution with unusually high grades (grade inflation)
- Vague descriptions across all roles
- Inconsistent timelines

## Critical Caveats

1. **Educational pedigree is context, not a hiring criterion**: Focus on actual work accomplishments and technical skills.

2. **Grade inflation varies**: Look for external validation through test scores, internships, and career progression.

3. **Self-selection effects**: Excellent engineers may choose mid-tier institutions for personal reasons.

4. **Coaching center culture**: High test scores may reflect test preparation more than raw ability.

5. **Work experience trumps education**: After 3-5 years, educational background becomes less predictive.
