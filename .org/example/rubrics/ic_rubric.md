## Cultural Bias Mitigation Notes

When evaluating resumes from different cultural backgrounds:

1. **Length doesn't indicate padding**: Some cultures value comprehensive CVs
2. **Ignore non-relevant personal info**: Age, photo, marital status, religion
3. **Look past formatting**: Focus on content, not presentation style
4. **Watch for language barriers**: Don't penalize ESL grammar if meaning is clear
5. **Accolades may differ**: "Employee of the month" vs. "Star performer" - evaluate the substance
6. **Educational systems vary**: Focus on practical experience over degree prestige
7. **Job titles are inconsistent**: A "Software Engineer" at one company = "Developer" elsewhere

**Core principle**: Evaluate what they've built and how they've grown, not how they've formatted their story.
