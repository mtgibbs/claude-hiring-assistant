## Cultural Bias Mitigation Notes

When evaluating manager resumes from different cultural backgrounds:

1. **Management titles vary wildly**: "Team Lead" might mean manager in one culture, IC in another
2. **Team sizes differ by company**: 3-person team at startup ≠ 3-person team at enterprise
3. **Formality in leadership**: Some cultures emphasize hierarchical respect, others flat structures
4. **Conflict resolution styles**: Direct confrontation vs. indirect harmony-seeking - both can work
5. **Decision-making approaches**: Consensus-driven vs. top-down - context matters
6. **Performance feedback**: Direct critical feedback vs. gentle constructive feedback - cultural norm
7. **Achievement language**: "We achieved" vs. "I led team to achieve" - both show leadership

**Core principle**: Evaluate outcomes (team performance, delivery, growth) not management style or cultural approach.

## Manager vs. IC Evaluation

**Key differences from IC rubric:**

| Category | IC Focus | Manager Focus |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Technical | Deep expertise in stack | Breadth and good judgment |
| Output | Code and features | Team output and velocity |
| Impact | Individual contribution | Team and organizational impact |
| Growth | Personal skill development | Team member development |
| Communication | Technical docs, code review | Stakeholder management, presentations |
| Success metric | Features shipped | Team success and growth |

**Don't expect managers to:**
- Be the best coder on the team
- Have deepest knowledge in every technology
- Spend 50%+ time coding
- Be individual high performer

**Do expect managers to:**
- Have credible technical background
- Make sound technical decisions
- Grow and develop people
- Deliver through their team
- Think strategically
- Communicate effectively across levels
